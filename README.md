# Book-search-engine

## Description
This application is a book search engine that uses google books API and MERN stack. The application uses `React` for the front end, `MongoDB`, `Node.js` and `Express.js`. This application uses an Apollo server with graphql mutations and queries in order for users to create an account, search for books, and save books to their account. The webpage has been deployed using Heroku.

## Future Development
For future development of this application, I would like to change the UI to be more uniform. I would change the cards for the books to have space around each item and for the description to have a character limit.
